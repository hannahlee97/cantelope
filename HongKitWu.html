            <p>Ken studies CST at BCIT this year. The reason why he chooses CST is because he loves computer so much. 
			He thought that Computer Science would be very easy for him as he started using computer since he was born. 
			However, the truth is totally different with what he thought. Therefore, he needs to put more effect in it in order to succeed.
			Studying will be the only mission Ken needs to do in the coming 4 years.</p>
