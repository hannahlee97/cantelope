            <p>Akemi was born in Nagano prefecture, in a village named Nozawa Onsen. She came to Canada for the summer/fall in 1998, going to school there for a while. She went back to Japan and then a year or so later, on October 02, 2000, she moved to Coquitlam, British Columbia. Right now she works in health care, and is hoping that she doesn't flunk out of this program so that she can get away from that particular field.</p>
